 Im coming up with marketing campaigns for hotels.
 Data has been collected to show the booking details from 2018 and 2019 of 2 successful hotels in Egypt,
 including different details about the customers and the services requested.
 What i will do :
 • Perform any necessary data cleaning & engineering that renders your data useable (i.e. handling
 missing values, duplicates, classification, transformation...etc.)
 • Derive 3 insights about attributes from the dataset using appropriate visualizations
 • Come up with 3 promotions to offer per hotel (must be supported by results of queries of your own
 creation)
 • Using SparkML, produce at least 3 models to predict whether a booking will be canceled or no
